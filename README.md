Signer client lib for PHP
====================================
**Standard version for PHP 5.5 or greater**

This library contains classes that encapsulate the calls to the Signer API.

The recommended way to install **Signer client lib** is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    "require": {
        "lacuna/signer-client": "1.4.6"
    }


This library depends on the GuzzleHttp package, which in turn requires PHP 5.5 or greater.
